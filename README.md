<h1>HTML5 & CSS3 challenge: Langing page</h1>

- Challenge for Junior Front-End Developer position</h3>

<h1>Assumptions</h1>

<h3>Comments</h3>

- I have included comments both in HTML and CSS to highlight the sections of the page. 

<h3>Variables</h3>

Challenge description suggests that I can use CSS variables or $ for SASS ("All colour, font size, font family settings should be set as variables /var() for CSS or $ for SASS/"), due to this I've decided to use CSS variables as this solution does not require a preprocessor.

<h3>Header</h3>

- Burger menu SVG is broken it shows as an empty square and therefore couldn't be added to the page. Since I can only use assets provided I have not added my own burger menu icon. Padding was applied to the element so that the header looks as if the burger SVG is there and overall page look is good. 


<h3>Games section</h3>

- I could't find background image for games section shown in desktop preview in assets folder so I used background color used in mobile view (#341F4A) as section background

<h3>Winners section</h3>

- I assumed that winners sting is a sliding text in all the views so I have added animation to it in mobile, tablet and desktop views.
